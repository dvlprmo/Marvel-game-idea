-- Developer Mohammad Aljagthmi  - Wed 11th, 03 2020
=================================================

-- Technology used thorugh out the projects:
  - HTML, CSS, JS and JQ. 
  - My wireframwork is drawn manully on a paper. (will be attached too). 

-- Important notes:
  - My project contains two versions of the same game which have levels of hard and easy. 
  - I prefered to use two separate files than using hide and show function to experinece the difference. 
  - There is a page that will show you your level in the process after a user complete the game either in easy or hard level. 
  - A challange is made by the developer that the first user gets 6/8 as a score in the hard level will be awarded 100 SAR. 

-- Screenshots of my design on a paper:

-- wireframes:

-- Instruction of downloading the project:
   >> copy the url of the repo and git clone it in prefered folder. 
   >> update as you like and git init then git add it. 
   >> after that, do commit with a explained message and push it to me. 
   >> I will check if your changes are deserved to be merged to my project when I see a pull request.

-- There is no unsolved problems but I think I tried to avoid them with more complex way. 
-- Some of my function:
   >> The difference between the hard level and easy level is the shuffle function that I use to shuffle cards each game, and that's why I call my game is a very hard, luck and nervy game. 
   >> play and pause music are worked in a way that exactly I want, and I used differet technique to do it but calling the function in the HTML code. 
   >> I had an idea to put a challange in a news style and I searched in Google in how to do that which ended up creating 4 divs inside each other with a very complex and weired css stylling.
